# Current Sprint Progress

## Sprint Goal
Setup foundation and validate architecture with Hello World POC

## Sprint Tasks

### Development Environment Setup âœ… COMPLETE
- [x] Complete development workflow setup
  - [x] Root git repository
  - [x] Directory structure
  - [x] .gitignore file
  - [x] Development scripts
  - [x] Enhanced CLAUDE.md
- [x] Git submodules conversion complete
- [x] Pre-commit configuration for root repository
- [x] EditorConfig for consistent coding standards

### Architecture Research and Planning âœ… COMPLETE
- [x] Comprehensive reference plugin analysis
  - [x] grian-horizon-plugin (simple HTMX prototype)
  - [x] manila-ui (mature established patterns)
  - [x] octavia-dashboard (modern AngularJS SPA)
  - [x] horizon core (framework integration points)
- [x] Pragmatic testing strategy for gating CI
- [x] "Modern Evolution" architecture decision documented
- [x] Implementation phases with testing approach

### POC Planning âœ… COMPLETE
- [x] Hello World POC feature planning
- [x] Simplified 3-commit approach defined
- [x] Testing workflow validation strategy
- [x] Current task documentation updated

### Ready for Implementation ðŸŽ¯ NEXT
- [ ] **Commit 1**: Panel group registration + smoke test
- [ ] **Commit 2**: Basic hello world panel + template test
- [ ] **Commit 3**: Fake API integration + contract test

## Completed This Sprint
- Complete development workflow setup with git submodules
- Comprehensive reference plugin analysis and architecture decisions
- Pragmatic testing strategy designed for gating CI requirements
- Hello World POC planned for architecture validation
- All foundational documentation and tooling in place

## Key Decisions Made
- **Architecture**: "Modern Evolution" approach (server-side + HTMX, not full SPA)
- **Testing**: Pragmatic workflow with FIXME pattern for bug reproducers
- **References**: Manila-UI patterns for structure, grian-prototype for simplicity
- **POC Scope**: Minimal 3-commit validation focusing on fundamentals

## Next Sprint Planning
- Hello World POC implementation and validation
- Testing workflow refinement based on real implementation
- Phase 2 POC planning (HTMX + error handling)
- Real telemetry service integration planning

## Notes
- All code changes must follow `refernce/openstack-ai-style-guide/docs/quick-rules.md`
- Use test-with approach for exploration, test-first for contracts
- Each commit must pass all tests (gating CI requirement)
- Focus on minimal viable implementation for workflow validation
