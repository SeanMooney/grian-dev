# Current Task

## Status: Ready to Implement Hello World POC

### Completed Work
- [x] Complete development workflow setup and repository structure
- [x] Git submodules conversion for reference projects
- [x] Comprehensive reference plugin analysis (grian-prototype, manila-ui, octavia-dashboard)
- [x] Pragmatic testing strategy for gating CI development
- [x] Hello World POC planning (simplified 3-commit approach)

### Current Task: Hello World POC Implementation
**Goal**: Validate architecture patterns and testing workflow with minimal feature

**Implementation Plan** (3 atomic commits):
1. **Panel group registration** + smoke test
   - File: `_80_grian_telemetry_panel_group.py`
   - Test: Verify "Telemetry" group appears in project dashboard

2. **Basic hello world panel** + template test
   - Files: `_90_grian_hello_world_panel.py`, panel.py, views.py, urls.py, index.html
   - Test: Verify panel loads and renders basic template

3. **Fake API integration** + contract test
   - Files: api/fake_telemetry.py, update view and template
   - Test: API contract and view integration

**Key Validations**:
- Reference patterns (manila-ui registration style)
- Testing workflow (test-with for structure, test-first for API)
- Gating CI compliance (all commits pass tests)
- OpenStack AI style guide compliance

**Files**: See `scratch/planning/hello-world.md` for complete plan

### Context for AI
- Always check this file before starting work
- Update progress as tasks are completed
- Follow testing strategy from `scratch/planning/testing-strategy.md`
- Reference patterns from `scratch/analysis/reference-review.md`

### Working Notes
- Following OpenStack AI style guide is mandatory
- Use test-with approach for exploration, test-first for contracts
- Each commit must pass all tests (gating CI requirement)
- Focus on minimal viable implementation for workflow validation
